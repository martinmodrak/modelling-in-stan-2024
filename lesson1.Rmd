## Basics of Bayesian Inference

- Bayes theorem for events
  - Exercise - which terms should go into nominator/denumerator?
- Bayes theorem for models

\begin{gather*}
    \pi_\text{joint}(y, \theta) = \pi_\text{obs}(y | \theta) \pi_\text{prior}(\theta)\\
    \pi_\text{marg}\left(y \right) = \int_\Theta \mathrm{d} \theta \: \pi_{\text{obs}}(y | \theta) \pi_\text{prior}(\theta)\\
    \pi_\text{post}(\theta | y) = \frac{\pi_\text{obs}(y | \theta) \pi_\text{prior}(\theta)}{\pi_\text{marg}\left(y \right)}.
\end{gather*}


- Bayesian statistics $\neq$ Bayesian epistemology
  - Catchall hypothesis
  - Compare to modern falsificationist ideas, notably Mayo
    - Liftoff
- Modelling notation, e.g.

$$
y \sim N(\mu,\sigma) \\
\mu \sim N(0, 1) \\
\sigma \sim HalfN(0, 2)
$$
- Modelled vs. unmodelled data

- Great intro to the underlying philosophical ideas: Chapters 1 - 2 of McElreath's "Statistical Rethinking" - available freely online at https://xcelab.net/rmpubs/sr2/statisticalrethinking2_chapters1and2.pdf
  - McElreath also has great free course on Bayesian statistics at https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2024
  
- Extracting information from probability distributions via expectation values (link Betancourt)

- MCMC algorithms allow us to sample posterior
  - What is a _chain_
  - Convergence
- HMC - show example, requires gradient
  - Conceptually two components --- random initial momentum for each trajectory 
    makes the chain explore, preference for high density regions makes the chain spend more time there.
  - Wax poetic how HMC is great
  - HMC will work great, if gradient is useful
  

- What is needed to be proficient at probabilistic programming?
  - Mathematical probability/statistics
  - Numerics
  - A little software engineering

## Basics of Stan

- Stan documentation: reference, function reference, user's guide
- Fundamentally a Stan program computes logarithm of the density (and its gradient, Hessian via autodiff)
  - Why logarithms?
- Stan is statically typed (and generally quite restrictive). Discuss pros and cons.
- Stan architecture: 
  - Math library + autodiff
  - The language
  - The interfaces
  - compiler to C++, compile C++
- Go through the "hello world" model ()
- Main program blocks
  - `data` (both modelled and non-modelled)
  - `parameters`
  - `model`
- `target += ` statements
- `_lpdf`

## The tasks

- Start a project to contain your coursework
- In general: we expect you to use online documentation etc. a lot, just like
in "real life"

## Summary after tasks

- Constraints
- Divergences as helpful diagnostics
- Discuss project proposals
