## First, let's slow down a bit

Try to complete [Task 3 and 4](lesson3-tasks.html#task-3-detecting-overdispersion-with-a-posterior-predictive-check) from Lesson 2 (and possibly others from the previous lessons)

Pick projects!

## Note on models

- Reuse methodology slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jkcKfTOupedZRoJZ9qSuGVDBjlzZFt6vOyEyN0pwduY/edit?usp=sharing

## Linear regression

- The most ubiquitous type of model --- see e.g. https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/
- Taylor series
- Intercept, coefficients
- Dummy coding
  - There are other ways to code (e.g. effect coding)
  - `model.matrix` in `R`
- Linear predictors and matrix multiplication
  - Intercept in the matrix
- Least squares and normal distribution
- Generalized linear models (GLM)
  - Link function, inverse link function
  - log for positive, logit for [0, 1].
- Posterior predictive checks as a method to determine which predictors to add

Now, let's do some tasks. Note that they match workflow (simple stuff first, ...)
